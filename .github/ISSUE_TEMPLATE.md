## Before opening an issue

* The issues aren't meant for support requests but for reporting bugs and feature requests. If you
have a support request then please use: http://metalsmith-slack.herokuapp.com/ or http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/metalsmith

* If you're reporting a bug, please open either a pull request with a failing test demonstrating the
problem, or include a link to a repository with a reduced test case demonstrating the problem.
